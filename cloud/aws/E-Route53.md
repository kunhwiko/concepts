### Overview
---
##### Route53
```
Route53 is AWS's highly available and scalable authoritative DNS service.
```

##### Hosted Zones
```
Hosted zones are analogous to a traditional DNS zone file, representing a collection of records that can be managed 
together and belonging to a single parent domain name. All record sets within a hosted zone must have the hosted zone's 
domain name. As an example, the amazon.com hosted zone may contain records named www.amazon.com, and www.aws.amazon.com.
```

### Route53 Configurations
---
##### TTL
```
TTL refers to how long a DNS record should be cached by the local DNS resolver. Higher TTL means less traffic to Route53,
but possibly outdated records. 
```

##### Accessibility
```
Hosted zones can be public for routing internet traffic or private for routing traffic within a VPC.
```

##### Health Checks
```
a) Health checks allow Route53 to check the health of an endpoint, health of other health checks, or health of CloudWatch
   alarms. Health checks allow for automated DNS failover if checks are failing. Firewalls must be configured to allow
   health checks to reach the endpoint.
b) Health checks cannot access endpoints on private hosted zones as it is outside the VPC. In case of private endpoints,
   health checks can be associated to CloudWatch alarms.
c) Multiple health checks can be combined into a single custom health check.
```

### Record Types & Route Policies
---
##### Alias Records
```
Alias records look similar to CNAME records, but carry the following differences:
  * Alias records are A or AAAA records that point to other AWS resources.
  * Unline CNAME records, alias records can map root domains to a different resource.
  * Alias records support health checks.
```

##### Simple Route Policy
```
Simple records are records with standard key to value mappings. Records can specify multiple values for a given key, and 
when multiple values are returned, a random value is selected by the client. Simple record sets do not support health checks.  
```

##### Weighted Route Policy
```
Weighted records allow traffic to be distributed based on a weight value. Health checks are supported for weighted 
records.
```

##### Multivalue Route Policy
```
Multivalue records are used to return multiple values in response to a DNS query. Unlike simple records with multiple 
values, health checks are supported for multivalue routing and Route53 will only return values that passed health checks.
```

##### Latency Route Policy
```
Latency routing allows traffic to be routed based on the lowest network latency from the client to the AWS region. 
Health checks are supported for latency routing.
```

##### Geolocation Route Policy
```
Geolocation routing allows traffic to be routed based on user location. A default record must be set for when none of the
locations match the user's location. Health checks are supported for geolocation routing.
```

##### Geoproximity Route Policy
```
Geoproximity routing allows traffic to be routed based on the location of users and resources. Bias values can be set to
bias traffic towards a specific location. This can be helpful if traffic needs to be shifted to a particular resource in
a specific location.
```

##### IP Based Route Policy
```
Route traffic based on CIDR ranges of clients.
```

##### Failover Route Policy
```
Failover records route traffic to a secondary endpoint when the primary endpoint is unhealthy as determined by health checks.
