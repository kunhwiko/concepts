### Overview
---
##### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
```
IAM is a globally scoped service that deals with secure access to AWS resources. It is used to centrally manage who is 
authenticated and authorized to use certain resources.
```

### IAM Users, Groups, and Roles
---
##### IAM Users
```
IAM users have defined permission policies that determine what the identity can do in AWS. This identity is uniquely 
associated with one person, and can access resources via access keys (i.e. long term credentials). 
```

##### IAM Group
```
When the number of IAM users increases, it becomes difficult to maintain permissions for each IAM user. To streamline 
the process, users can be grouped into IAM groups so that permissions can be collectively granted. 

Groups can only consist of users. Users do not need to belong to a group, but can belong to multiple groups. When a
user belongs to multiple groups, all policies from that group will be inherited to the user.
```

##### IAM Role
```
IAM role is an identity that is usually assumed by a service. These roles rely on temporary security credentials 
generated through STS to perform actions in AWS. Like IAM users, roles can be attached with IAM policies that define the 
scope of permissions.
```

##### Service Linked Role
```
A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on one's behalf. A service linked role is a 
service role that is predefined by an AWS service and includes all the permissions that the service requires to call 
other AWS services. Service linked roles can typically be assumed only by the linked AWS service.
```

##### Security Token Service (STS)
```
Entities with IAM roles attached will make an API request to the AWS STS endpoint for temporary security credentials, 
which are dynamically generated by STS when the request is made. Various STS API operations exist (e.g. AssumeRole,
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity) that can be found here:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison
```

##### Trust Policy
```
JSON documentation that defines which principals can assume the IAM role and under what conditions.
```

##### Federation
```
Federation
- Creation of a trust relationship between an external identity provider and AWS. 
- Trust relationships can be established via OIDC or SAML, which can be used to assign IAM roles to federated users.

Federated Users
- Existing user identities outside AWS (e.g. IdPs) who can be granted temporary access to AWS resources.
```

### IAM Permissions
---
##### IAM Policy Types
```
Managed Policy: 
- Standalone policy that is defined and maintained by AWS. These policies are predefined for convenience reasons.

Customer Managed Policy:
- Customers can define their own standalone policy and attach this policy to any number of users, groups, and roles.

Inline Policy:
- Policy that is directly embedded into a single IAM identity. The policy maintains a strict one-to-one relationship 
  between a policy and an identity.  
```

##### Resource Based Policy
```
Instead of associating permissions to a user to be able to perform certain actions, policies can be attached at a 
resource level. Resource-based policies remove the need to associate permissions to individual users. Only certain 
resources currently support resource-based policies (e.g. Lambda, S3, SQS, SNS).

When an IAM role is assumed, the user or service temporarily forgoes the original permissions that they have, but users 
are able to keep their original permissions when resource-based policies are used. 
```

##### IAM Boundaries
```
Boundaries are used to limit the permissions that an identity can have. Even if a user has full admin privileges, they
can be restricted by a boundary policy.
```

##### IAM Evaluation Logic

### Cognito
---
##### Cognito Basics
```
Amazon Cognito gives users outside AWS an identity to interact with web and mobile applications. User pools provide sign
in functionality and can be integrated with API Gateway or ALBs. Identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials to 
```

##### User Pools
```
a) User pools provide sign-in functionality with username and password authentication, MFA, or through federated identity 
   providers (e.g. Google, Facebook, SAML).
b) After authenticating, users retrieve tokens from user pools that are then passed on to an API Gateway or ALB to 
   authorize API calls. The API Gateway and ALB will evaluate the token with Cognito to authorize the request.
```

##### Identity Pools
```
a) Identity pools (federated identities) allow clients to obtain temporary AWS credentials. Clients authenticate and
   retrieve tokens through Cognito user pools or through third party logins (e.g. Google, Facebook, SAML, OIDC). The 
   token is then exchanged for temporary AWS credentials with Cognito identity pools. After Cognitio validates the token 
   with third party providers, it will return credentials to the client.
b) IAM policies applied to the temporary credentials are defined in Cognito.
